            <b>About Me</b>
          </h2>
          <p>
            I portray myself as a computer science professional with a Master's
            degree from California State University-Long Beach, my love for
            computer science was a gradual journey for me and it all started
            with writing a code in C almost a decade ago!! From there, learning
            and working on some major facets of computer science subject, not
            only helped me to learn but paved a path for my dream to become
            subject matter expert in that field. I am passionate about coding
            and I love to learn different technologies especially web UI
            development. My expertise and knowledge made me confirmable to
            flourish best in the area of web development and front-end
            development roles. In my free time, you can find me to do painting,
            playing badminton and at the beach.Â
